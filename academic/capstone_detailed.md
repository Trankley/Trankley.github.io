<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

The Hover DR1 was developed to solve the challenge of making STEM education engaging and accessible for students. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to capture attention or provide practical applications for core engineering and computer science concepts. The audio-reactive hoverboard bridges this gap by transforming abstract principles into a tangible, interactive experience that allows students to customize and control settings directly. It fosters creativity and teamwork through collaborative experimentation, making it easier for students to grasp difficult concepts while having fun. By providing a hands-on platform that turns theory into practice, the Hover DR1 inspires the next generation of engineers and scientists through an accessible, immersive learning environment.
