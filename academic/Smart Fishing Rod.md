<h2>Overview</h2>

The Smart Fishing Rod revolutionizes the fishing experience by incorporating cutting-edge IoT technology to enhance angler performance and enjoyment. Designed for precision and ease, this smart device integrates advanced sensors and real-time data analytics to offer unprecedented insights into the fishing activity.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Precision Bite Detection</b>:
        Utilizes a tachometer to detect fish bites accurately, increasing the chance of a successful catch. </li>
        
<p align="center"><img src= "/images/fishing-rod/fishingRodUI.png" Width=600/>
    <li><b>Cast Distance Measurement</b>:
        Employs the same high-accuracy tachometer to measure the distance of each cast, allowing anglers to fine-tune their casting techniques.</li>
    <li><b>Fish Species Identification</b>:
        Features a multi-class object detection algorithm that identifies up to 31 different fish species with over 80% accuracy using a built-in camera system.</li>
