<h1>Hover DR1</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The Hover DR1 transforms an ordinary hoverboard into an audio-reactive drone that responds to music and sound, turning a standard device into an engaging educational tool. Designed specifically to introduce children and teens to the fundamentals of computer science, mechanics, and engineering, the Hover DR1 provides a fun and interactive way to learn these principles.
