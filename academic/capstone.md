<h1 align="center">Hover DR1</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Hover DR1 was the senior design project that I led to first place at our senior design EXPO.

The hoverboard is a once popular transportation platform, often used as a toy, that is now left behind as electronic waste collecting dust in many peopleâ€™s homes. We have been tasked with creating a module that will utilize the old hoverboards in new ways. Our module allows users of all ages and skill levels to add audio based commands to their hoverboards. In doing so, students gain experience and learn the fundamentals of programming and engineering. For those who are more familiar with engineering concepts, the module allows them to create their own custom reactions for the hoverboards they already own using audio cues, driven by a microphone module, a motor, and an Arduino Uno device. Due to the modular nature of our solution, it can fit on nearly all hoverboard models, and is mounted externally to prevent voiding device warranties.

Part of this project was creating and launching kickstarter so that we could experience what its like to actually bring a product to market. To see our kickstarter campaign click the link below.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Audio Reactivity</b>: Utilizes fourier transforms that translates audio frequencies into movement, allowing the hoverboard to react dynamically to music and sounds.</li>
<li><b>Educational Platform</b>: Serves as a learning module to teach children and teens about basic principles of coding, circuitry, mechanics</li>
  <li><b>Safety Design</b>: Equipped with advanced safty features to ensure the device is both fun and safe for young users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Arduino Uno</b>: The core of the device.</li>
  <li><b>L298N H-Bridge Motor Controller</b>: To step up voltage from 5V to 12V.</li>
  <li><b>KY-037 Microphone</b>: To recive audio input.</li>
  <li><b>12V Geared Motor</b>: To drive the direction controls.</li>
  <li><b>Frame Material</b>: PLA for cost effectiveness and ease of access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Interactive Learning</b>:  Includes a user-friendly interface that allows learners to interact with the hoverboard through a dedicated educational app, which explains the science behind each feature.</li>
  <li><b>Customizable Settings</b>: Users can customize the audio sensitivity and response patterns, making each experience unique and tailored to individual learning paces. </li>
  <li><b>Community Sharing</b>: We provide a platform for users to share their custom settings and experiences with an online community, fostering collaboration and further learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Expandable Modules</b>: Future versions will include additional modules that can teach other STEM topics, such as radar and artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li><b>Enhanced Interactivity</b>: Plans to integrate more interactive features like gesture-based controls and real-time data visualization of sound waves and board responses.</li>
  <li><b>Broader Educational Reach</b>: Aiming to partner with schools and educational programs to incorporate the Hover DR1 into curriculums and after-school programs.</li>
</ul>
